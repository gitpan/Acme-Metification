=head1 NAME

Acme::Metification - Give Perl the power of Metaprogramming!

=head1 VERSION

Current version is 1.000.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::Metification;
  # This is line 0
  
  sub faculty {
     my $no = shift;
     my $fac = 1;
     $fac *= ($no--);
     return $fac if $no == 0;
     recursemeta depth => 100, 5, 7
     # ^^ insert lines 5 to 7 up to 100 times
     return $fac;
  }
  
  print faculty(4); # prints 24 after quite some time

=head1 NOTE

Do not, I repeat, do not use in production code. But then again, the
features are useless, so you wouldn't anyway.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module gives you some meta-programming abilites within Perl.
It uses source filters to do evil things with your source.

The module allows the use of two new functions. They must
appear on separate lines in your code:

=head2 meta

Syntax:

  meta [line_no1], [line_no2]

C<meta> replaces itself with the code lines ranging from
[line_no1] to [line_no2]. The first line after
"use Acme::Metification;" is considered line 0.

Of course, those lines may contain C<meta> or C<recursemeta>
directives, so beware of deep recursion.

=head2 recursemeta

Similar to C<meta> with some exceptions. Syntax:

  recursemeta depth => [depth], [line_no1], [line_no2]

[depth] is the maximum depth to recurse into in case
C<recursemeta> directives are inserted. However,
C<meta> directives will be recursed into deeply.
